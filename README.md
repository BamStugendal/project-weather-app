# Weather App

This week's project is to build a weather web app that shows current weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using a weather API.

## The problem

I started with fetching information from the API and read the endpoint documentation to get to know the API structure and how I can get the information I needed. After I fetching what I needed I made a function that I could reuse and call after fetch. After that, I started doing the design.  

If I had more time, I would have like to use the Geolocation API to get the position. And change the background image depending on temperature.
